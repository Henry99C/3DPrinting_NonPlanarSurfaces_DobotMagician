# DESCRIPTION OF FILES
<p align=justify><b>Data1</b> contains the cube to be printed on the pyramid. As shown in the figure, the points are obtained from the slicer JSON file and a post-processing is performed in which a frame is rotated to be aligned with the vector and the points are referenced to the base of the robot. In this case, additional post-processing was necessary, whereby a set of points were augmented and some vectors were corrected.</p>

<p align=justify><b>Data2</b> contains the blade of the blade to be printed on the semi-axis. As shown in the figure, the points are obtained from the JSON file of the slicer and a post-processing is performed in which a frame is rotated so that it is aligned to the vector and the points are referenced to the robot base.</p>

<p align=justify><b>Data3</b> contains the cube to be printed on top of a sphere. As shown in the figure, the points are obtained from the JSON file of the slicer and a postprocessing is performed in which a frame is rotated so that it is aligned to the vector and the points are referenced to the base of the robot.</p>

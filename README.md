# 3D printing system on non-planar surfaces using a robotic arm

<p>The Fused Deposition Modeling is a technique within Additive Manufacturing, in which a part is formed by stacking two-dimensional layers, using a technique known as 2.5 axis, with which there are certain defects such as the staircase effect, the decrease of resistance in the printing direction, the use of supports and limitations such as printing on flat surfaces. In order to reduce these limitations and defects, the design of a 3D printing system on non-planar surfaces using the Dobot Magician robotic arm, to which a 3D printing system is adapted and its degrees of freedom are increased. Additionally, the kinematics calculation is performed through the Denavit-Harterg parameters, and a 3D printing <a href="https://github.com/compas-dev/compas_slicer">slicer</a> for multi-axis machines is selected and configured. Finally, a comparison is made between the parts printed by non-planar printing and traditional printing, obtaining a decrease of the staircase effect and an error of 6.125% in the width of the compared part.</p>
